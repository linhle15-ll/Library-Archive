- Question: in the method addResource, after trying over and over, I realised that resources are just really added all if I initialize numLibResource as an
instance variable instead setting it in the addResource itself. 
However, in the method public Resource[] getUnavailable(), for example, I can still set the numAvailable resource = 0 right in the method.
